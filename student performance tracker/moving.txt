how to move code between VSCode -> Visual Studio

create a .NET project using:
    dotnet new console -n GradeEvaluator

or for Windows Forms:
    dotnet new winforms -n CounterApp

Commit and push your project using GitHub Desktop
On another computer with Visual Studio:
Clone the repo via GitHub Desktop.
Open the .sln (solution) or .csproj file directly 
    in Visual Studio.
Visual Studio will automatically load dependencies 
    and allow you to switch between console and GUI projects.
